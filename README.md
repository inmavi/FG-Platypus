The purpose of this aircraft is to provide training wheels for getting to know the various instruments, scenarios for both IFR VFR flights and lots more

Its name is derived from the Australian marsupial, as the aircraft borrows many instruments and features from a wide range of Flightgear aircrafts and developers.

The aircraft does not exist in the real world as it simply is a mockup of what kind of instruments may be found on a GA type aircraft.
The emphasis rests on user friendlyness rather then beeing authentic.

If you wish to contribute the following streams could do with some work:

Aircraft Specific -

just check the todo and bug doco
add something like the fg1000 or something less impacting on the framerate to replace the DG Panel
anything to make the flight experience more enjoyable
whatever you think may add value

Nav-Scenario Specific -

improvement of existing scenarios
addition of new ones e.g. fly a DME arc, RNAV, Radar Vectors, etc

Maintenance -

xml and nas code needs to be brought up to standard
the documentation needs a complete overhaul


Basically the aim is to provide an easy to use interface and tools for complete novices to aeronautical navigation.
