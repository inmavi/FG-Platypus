nav scenarios and quickstarts need some error handling if runway entered incorrect - at the moment causing a nasal error on line 309

windconfig  - only works with basic weather, need to execute apply button with weather dialog hidden - sort of needs a fake enter key press

Somethings wrong - fuelflow drops with strong headwind ???

Views need fixing -

Fix reset behaviour on nav scenarios -occasional
