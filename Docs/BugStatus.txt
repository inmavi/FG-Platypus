reset failures in between scenarios and gen startup

davtron sometimes not displaying info after quickstart

windconfig  - only works with basic weather, need to execute apply button with weather dialog hidden

Somethings wrong - fuelflow drop with strong headwind ???

Views need fixing -

the front view is actually the helicopter view and the helicopter view is the model view
only confusing when using instant replay

Fix - too many poi open message on fuel alert popup

need to synchronise pilot seat default values and view values, seem to be identical but resets are different.

sometimes nav lights detach from wing while turning
