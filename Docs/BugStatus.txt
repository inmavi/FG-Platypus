non objects have no members nasal error 
line 838 action sim caused by atis procedure

Wind Config needs to be adjusted for user switching weather scenario as the code does not place the check into manual config, thus blocking the windsim dialog.

Nav Scen 2 and 3 (approach) at times have problem with rwy 34 at lszh and loww, the reciprocals ils works well on 16 but 
once on 34 the aircraft turns a 180 degrees even though frequency and radial correct in radio.

eddf shows longest runway ils frequency twice in fuelstatus

pilot head distorted depending on view angle

vor s seem to be incorrect maybe because of view settings '??

eddm has atis console shows freq in console but com not updated ???

if option rendering als checked landing light is on even though switch is in off position

review nearest ap code as not always in sync with sim closest ap

nav scenarios and quickstarts need some error handling if runway entered incorrect - at the moment causing a nasal error on line 309
replace input with a combo

Somethings wrong - fuelflow drops with strong headwind ???

Views need fixing -

the front view is actually the helicopter view and the helicopter view is the model view
only confusing when using instant replay

Fix - too many poi open message on fuel alert popup, but not when opened manually

Fix reset behaviour on nav scenarios -occasional 
crash at startup as reset does not clear previous properties when switching from airborne to runway

hanging stopwatch needs lights

hide that "file opens in a webbrowser" msg or autoclose onc the doc is open.
