If you want the mousewheel to zoom views while in mouse mode 0 you can replace the original mice.xml in Flightgear 20xx.x.x/data with the mice_wheelControlsZoom.xml and rename it to mice.
To restore the original, just copy back the mice_original and rename it to mice.

If you would like to switch the mousewheel to either zoom or trim elevator use the above steps with the ChangeMouseWheelAction file.
In this case you also need to open /systems/pa28_keyboard.xml and uncomment key 

<!-- uncomment if you change mice.xml to toggle

		<key n="85">
                <name>U</name>


After this you can use <Shift>+<U> to toggle the wheel mode.

If in zoom mode the wheel should not be used on levers like the throttle ???

In either case also go to WarriorII-main.xml in the aircrafts folder and comment out the secondary input

<input>
		<keyboard include="Systems/pa28-keyboard.xml"/>
<!--
		<mice include="Systems/Pa28-mice.xml"/>
-->
	</input>

if not already as shown above.
